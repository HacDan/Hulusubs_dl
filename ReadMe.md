# Hulu Subs Downloader
Little Python Script to download subtitles from hulu. Made for educational purposes (yeah,right).


# POINT TO REMEMBER

1.) This script currently downloads the subs in VTT format. You'll have to manually convert them to srt or whatever format you want them in.
I'd recommend looking at ffmpeg, if you want easy and free solution to this. 

2.) This Script only downloads subs from videos that are FREE to stream.

3.) Country restrictions Apply (I Guess). Please report if it does (It shouldn't though)

4.) Read the "Features To Come" (Look At Bottom).


# Are there any threads for this thing?

None. And I don't plan on making one. Just pull up requests on github or email me (Look At Bottom).


# What do I need to run this thing?

1.) Python 2.7.x

# Python Libraries Required

1.) BeautifulSoup 4.3.2 (Included Within This Script)

2.) requests (Included Withing This Script)

3.) Time (Already There In Python)

4.) xml.etree.ElementTree (Already There In Python)

5.) FileInput (Already There In Python)

6.) OS (Already There In Python)

So, You don't really Need to install or download anything extra.


# How do I do what I have to do? (Simple Guide)

1.) Run "HuluSubs.py" File. (Run within CMD if you want to see the errors,if any).

2.) Paste the video Link when it asks . For Ex :- http://www.hulu.com/watch/815743

Note :- Remove all the special characters from the URL,if any. Sometimes there are certain special values like "#0#1#78" etc.

3.) After entering the url, press 'ENTER' and sit back while it Downloads the Subs.

4.) Check this folder and you'll see your "vtt" Subtitles.


# Features To Come / Planned Updates

This is a script I made in my free time to ease my job of getting subs for some korean drama series (Yes, I watch 'em).
Anyways, Some planned updates are :

1.) Converting subs to "srt" format for easy viewing.

2.) Downloading subs for "Subscription" based videos.

3.) Remove geo-restriction (if any).
