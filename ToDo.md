# To Do
Things that I have in mind, things that I want to include later in this script/tool.
- Encrypt Cookie saved in the text file. Currently it's saved in plain text and if anyone gets access to it, they can exploit it.
- Use authentication APIs from Hulu to remove the un-necessary step of fetching Cookies manually.
- Be able to see if cookies have expired and ask the user again for input and update the current values.
